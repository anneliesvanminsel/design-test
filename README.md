### Gebruiken van Sass

I started with adding a general .scss-file. Then i added a variables.scss file.
in that file i added the used colors and the breakpoints i will be using to make the project responsive.

the markup from the scss-files are the same as i learned at my internship. It has
been lerned to me by using ESlint. 

Every component gets its own .scss-file.
